# Workstation Automations

A series of AppleScripts, plugins, etc. for various desktop applications that I use.

The first rule of this repository: THERE ARE NO RULES. Trying to deploy proper software development practices on end-user programmable scripting stuff is a fool's errand. I will automate what tests I can, but expect a series of square pegs and round holes when trying to apply normal dev tooling to this kind of thing.

Everything here is "for your information" open-source. I will only make whatever effort is required to get (and keep) these things working on my current workstations. No other configurations or backwards compatibility will be entertained.
